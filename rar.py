"""
from http://www.ssokolow.com/scripts/rar.py
A pure-Python module for identifying and examining RAR files developed without
any exposure to the original unrar code. (Just format docs from wotsit.org)

It was, however, influenced by the zipfile module in the Python standard
library as, having already decided to match the zipfile.ZipFile API as closely
as feasibly possible, I didn't see a point to doing extra work to come up with
new ways of laying out my code for no good reason.

@todo: Determine how rarfile (http://rarfile.berlios.de/) compares to this in
various target metrics. If it is superior or close enough on all fronts,
patch it as necessary and plan a migration path. Otherwise, do the following:
 - Complete the parsing of the RAR metadata.
   (eg. Get data from archive header, check CRCs, read cleartext comments, etc.)
 - Optimize further and write a test suite.
 - Double-check that ZipFile/ZipInfo API compatibility has been maintained
   wherever feasible.
 - Support extraction of files stored with no compression.
 - Look into supporting split and password-protected RARs.
 - Some password-protected RAR files use blocks with types 0x30, 0x60, and 0xAD
   according to this code. Figure out whether it's a bug or whether they're really
   completely new kinds of blocks. (Encrypted headers for filename-hiding?)
 - When the appropriate code is available, use the following message for failure
   to extract compressed files::
    For reasions of patent, performance, and a general lack of motivation on the
    author's part, this module does not extract compressed files.
